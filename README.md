# Weather App

This is a project to enhance my knowledge on how to make an API call using Ajax.

## Description

We take the input (City Name) from the user, and with the help of js code, we call the API asynchronously. The API provides the response in the form of JSON Object.Now we have to parse the JSON Object and get the important details like City Name, Temperature, Minimum Temperature, Maximum Temperature, Humidity, Weather Description, Wind Speed and the Country from the JSON Object and we can render the details onto the table.

The API used in the project is [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/)
